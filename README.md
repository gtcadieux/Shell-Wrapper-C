This is a shell-wrapper written in C. This program can be compiled like any other C program.
Has three internal commands: exit, cd, and jobs.
- Exit exits the program
- cd is used to change directory
- jobs is used to list current jobs running in the background

Note: To run an executable in the background the '&' symbol must be attached to the end of the executable
